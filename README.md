# Rock-Paper-Scissors-DApp
This is an decentralized application (dApp) that implements a simplified Rock–Paper–Scissors game on Ethereum-compatible testnets. A player chooses Rock / Paper / Scissors in the browser UI. Each play creates a blockchain transaction that calls the smart contract's play(uint8 _move) function.
